# Multiplier

The multiplier will multiply the values at **A** and **B** and will also add 1 to the output value if **CIN** is high. Since multiplication could potentially double the amount of needed bits to represent the resulting value. The upper bits are at **COUT**, and the lower bits are at **S**.
