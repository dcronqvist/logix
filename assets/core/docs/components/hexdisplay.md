# Hex Display

The Hex Display will display the currently inputted value in hexadecimal, using a kind of 7-segment display. It can be used to display the value of a register, or the value of a counter, or whatever else you'd like to display. You can also set the amount of input bits using the **Data Bits** property, which will change the amount of digits displayed.
