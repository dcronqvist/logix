# D-Flip-Flop

The D-Flip-Flop will allow you to store a single bit of data. On a rising edge of the **>** (clock) pin, the value at the **D** (data) pin will be stored in the flip-flop. The value stored in the flip-flop can be read from the **Q** (output) pin, and its complement can be read from the **!Q** (output complement) pin.

The **R** pin will asynchronously reset the flip-flop to a low value.
