# Multiplexer

The multiplexer is a very useful component that allows you to select which of its inputs to pass through to its output. By setting the **Select Bits** in its properties, you can select how many bits you want to use to select which input to pass through. For example, if you set the **Select Bits** to 2, you can select from 4 different inputs using 2 bits. If you set the **Select Bits** to 3, you can select from 8 different inputs using 3 bits.

You can also set the **Data Bits** in its properties, which will allow you to set the number of bits that will be passed through to the output. For example, if you set the **Data Bits** to 4, you can pass through 4 bits of data from one of the inputs to the output.
