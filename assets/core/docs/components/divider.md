# Divider

The divider component will divide the values at **A** (**A** is the lower bits, and the upper bits at **DUP**), by the value at **B**. The result will be at **S**. The remainder will be at **REM**. In the case of division by zero, the result will be high impedance, and the **Z** pin will be high.
