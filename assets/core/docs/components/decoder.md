# Decoder

The decoder is very similar to the [demultiplexer](component://logix_core:script/DEMULTIPLEXER), however it doesn't allow you to pass through any data, it only allows you to select which of its outputs to set to high. This is useful in cases where you want to convert a binary number to a decimal number, for example.
