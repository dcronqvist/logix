# SR Latch

The SR Latch is a type of latch that has two inputs, S and R, and two outputs, Q and Q'. The Q output is set to 1 when S is 1 and R is 0, and is set to 0 when S is 0 and R is 1. The Q' output is the opposite of Q.

Below is a truth table for the SR Latch:

| S   | R   | Q   | Q'  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | Q   | Q'  |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   |
