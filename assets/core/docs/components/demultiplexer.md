# Demultiplexer

The demultiplexer is very similar to the [multiplexer](component://logix_core:script/MULTIPLEXER), however it goes in the opposite direction, allowing you to redirect a single input to a set of outputs, that is specified by the **Select Bits**. Once again, the amount of bits you want to pass can be specified with the **Data Bits** property.
