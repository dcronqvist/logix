# ![image](core.texture.icon) LogiX - About

LogiX is an open source, cross platform, logic circuit simulator that can be used to create and simulate logic circuits. It has been developed with the intention of being used in education, but can of course be used for other purposes as well. With the possibility of programming and creating your own components, you as a developer are free to create plugins that can be used to extend the functionality of LogiX.
