# ðŸ”Œ logix

simulator for logic gates and integrated circuits (WIP)

![Showcasing an example circuit](media/full_adder_showcase.gif)

## Getting started

If you just want to get your hands dirty and start placing out logic gates and make circuits, all you'll need is a `dotnet` runtime, and to clone down the repository.

The `.csproj` targets `.NET 6`, so you'll need a runtime with version >= 6.

```
git clone https://github.com/dcronqvist/logix
cd logix/src/LogiX
dotnet run
```
