Simulator for logic gates and circuits.

![Showcasing an example circuit](media/full_adder_showcase.gif)

There are a few example projects in the [`examples`](/examples/) directory, which can be opened up in the editor, on simulated on the command line.

## Getting started

If you just want to get your hands dirty and start placing out logic gates and make circuits, all you'll need is a `dotnet` runtime, and to clone down the repository.

The `.csproj` targets `.NET 7`, so you'll need a runtime with version >= 7.

```
git clone https://github.com/dcronqvist/logix
.utils/setup.ps1
cd logix/src/LogiX
dotnet run
```
