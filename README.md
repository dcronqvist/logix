# logix
ðŸ”Œ simulator for logic gates and integrated circuits, created with [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) and made cross-platform using .NET (6)

## Getting started

If you just want to get your hands dirty and start placing out logic gates and make circuits, all you'll need is a `dotnet` runtime, and to clone down the repository. 

The `.csproj` targets `.NET 6`, so you'll need a runtime with version >= 6.

```
git clone https://github.com/dcronqvist/logix
cd logix
dotnet run
```
