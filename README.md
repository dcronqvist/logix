# ðŸ”Œ logix

Simulator for logic gates and circuits.

Below is an example gif of the [8-bit computer designed and built by Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyznrdDSSGM&list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU), implemented in LogiX (exists as en [example project](/examples/beneater-8bit/)). In the gif, a very simple program is loaded into memory that is incrementing a counter and displaying the result on the `OUTPUT` pins.

There are a few example projects in the [`examples`](/examples/) directory, which can be opened up in the editor, on simulated on the command line.

## Getting started

If you just want to get your hands dirty and start placing out logic gates and make circuits, all you'll need is a `dotnet` runtime, and to clone down the repository.

The `.csproj` targets `.NET 7`, so you'll need a runtime with version >= 7.

```
git clone https://github.com/dcronqvist/logix
.utils/setup.ps1
cd logix/src/LogiX
dotnet run
```
