# LogiX - Keyboard Testing project

This small project is used to demonstrate the use of the keyboard input system in LogiX, as well as the TTY system. Together with the project, an `Action Sequence` file is provided which can be used when simulating the project on the command line - it connects the keyboard component in the project to the host's keyboard, as well as the TTY component to the host's TTY that launched the simulation. This allows you to interact with your simulation as if it were running for real.
