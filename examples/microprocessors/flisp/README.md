# FLISP

This is the micro processor that is described in the course [EDA452 Introduction to computer engineering](https://student.portal.chalmers.se/en/chalmersstudies/courseinformation/Pages/SearchCourse.aspx?course_id=31745&parsergrp=3) at Chalmers. The course resources contains software to simulate the FLISP micro processor, but for someone who might want to look further into how the FLISP processor works, all the way to the gate level, this might be something you want to check out.

As of yet, only the FLISP ALU is implemented, a lot of work remains to fully implement the entire processor, but eventually we'll get there. Simply open up the `flisp.lgxpr` project in LogiX and play around. The simulator is yours.
